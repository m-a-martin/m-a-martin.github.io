I am an evolutionary biologist and infectious diseae epidemiologist with a focus on using genomic data to better understand the dynamics of human pathogens. Broadly speaking, I am interested in identifying novel data signatures in pathogen genomic data and developing quantitative analyitcal methods to generate epidemiological and evolutionary insights from those signals. My work spans biological scales, from within-host pathogen evolution to pathogen dynamics on the host population scale. I have a particular interest in analyses that link these two scales, e.g. through the transmission bottleneck. 

I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow in [Dr. M. Kate Grabowski](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/Kate+K.+Grabowski/2777015)'s lab as a part of the [Infectious Disease Dynamics](https://www.iddynamics.jhsph.edu) group at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My work is funded in part by the [PANGEA-HIV](https://www.pangea-hiv.org) consortium and most of my current work is done in collaboration with the [Rakai Health Sciences Program](https://www.rhsp.org). I am currently focused on a number of HIV-related research projects including the evolution and transmission and HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) resistance, long-term evolutionary impacts of ART scale-up, and the identificaiton of HIV mixed infections. 

I completd my doctoral training in [Dr. Katia Koelle](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/koellelab/)'s group as part of the [Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution](https://biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/PBEE/index.html) graduate program. My work there was funded in part by an NIH NIAID F31 fellowship to on the evolution of influenza defective viral genomes within- and between-hosts. I also spent quite a bit of time researching SARS-CoV-2 during my doctoral training including [estimation of the transmission bottleneck](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abh1803) and [phylodynamic epidemiological modeling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19248-0). 

Pior to my doctoral training I earned a master's in epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health where I did research in the [Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics](https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu) with Dr. Bill Hanage. Here I mainly focused on the [within-host genomic diversity of *M. tuberculosis*](https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000217). 

# News
## 2024
- My work on the within- and between-host dynamics of influenza A virus defective viral genomes is now out in [Virus Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veae042) [\[PDF\]](https://m-a-martin.github.io/files/influenza_dvgs.pdf). This work was (mostly) compmleted during my doctoral research in [Dr. Katia Koelle](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/koellelab/)'s group. 
- I finally found the motivation to make a professional website. Thakn you [Clif McKee](https://clifmckee.github.io) for the nudge.
