I am an evolutionary biologist and infectious diseae epidemiologist with a focus on using genomic data to better understand the dynamics of human pathogens. Broadly speaking, I am interested in identifying novel data signatures in pathogen genomic data and developing quantitative analyitcal methods to generate epidemiological and evolutionary insights. My work spans biological scales, from within-host pathogen evolution to pathogen dynamics on the host population scale. I have a particular interest in analyses that link these two scales, e.g. through the transmission bottleneck. 

I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow in [Dr. M. Kate Grabowski](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/Kate+K.+Grabowski/2777015)'s lab as a part of the [Infectious Disease Dynamics](https://www.iddynamics.jhsph.edu) group at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My work is funded in part by the [PANGEA-HIV](https://www.pangea-hiv.org) consortium and most of my current work is done in collaboration with the [Rakai Health Sciences Program](https://www.rhsp.org). I am currently focused on a number of HIV-related research projects including the evolution and transmission and HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) resistance, long-term evolutionary impacts of ART scale-up, and the identificaiton of HIV mixed infections.

- My work on the within- and between-host dynamics of influenza A virus defective viral genomes is now out in [Virus Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veae042) [\[PDF\]](https://m-a-martin.github.com/files/influenza_dvgs.pdf). This work was (mostly) compmleted during my doctoral research in [Dr. Katia Koelle](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/koellelab/)'s group. 
- I finally found the motivation to make a professional website. Thakn you [Clif McKee](https://clifmckee.github.io) for the nudge.
